## Bitcoin 101 Slide Deck ##

These are (a quick hack at) html5 slides for a bitcoin-101 talk.

They are based on the stack repo: https://github.com/mbostock/stack

I might clean these up at some point in the future, but as-is I thought the collection of images might be useful to people doing similar talks. Some of the graphics are "borrowed" from the textbook _Mastering Bitcoin_ which can be found here: https://github.com/aantonop/bitcoinbook

Included but unused images are:

* cloak.png
* foldapp.png
* obituaries.png

Edit the index.html file to create a different presentation.
